# Loan_Defaults_Dashboard

I'm excited to share my latest project: a loan default dashboard that provides insights into the factors that contribute to loan defaults, loans provided and many more. The dashboard is based on data from a large #bank and includes information on the borrowers' jobs, ages, education levels, and whether they defaulted on their loans .

## What I actually did here?

### Data Cleaning:
I took the unstructured data , delimited it and removed the duplicates of the data and arranged it in much more clean and organized way so that it'll be much more easy to analyze . All the cleaning processes were done in excel itself.

### Analyze:
I made few pivot tables tables based on information that I need. Then I analyzed the data to finally conclude that only 2% of the people in that bank defaults a loan and they do have less balance for them to pay. The analysing were easier by using default functions in Microsoft Excel. The amount of defaults were easily found by using functions in Excel.

### Visualizations:
Using the pivottables , I made pivot charts so that the data is in much more presentable way and also used slicers to quickly filter through data. Then by merging all the various charts, we get the dashboard. The dashboard were tweaked a little so that it is neatly arranged and positioned properly.  

The dashboard involves few charts like loans given based on jobs, and in that amount of housing loans given, balance each person has based on age and whether they defaults or not... The dashboard is designed to help lenders make more informed lending decisions. By understanding the factors that contribute to loan default, lenders can better assess the risk of lending to borrowers. This can help to reduce the number of loans that default, which can save lenders money and protect their bottom line.
